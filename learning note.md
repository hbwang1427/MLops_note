## MLops vs Devops

DevOps is a contraction of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). It combines two essential functions of the IT department: application development and systems engineering.  DevOps tries to shorten development cycles—and accelerate the velocity of output for software engineering teams. It does so by introducing automation, updated processes, and working methods for development teams. More broadly, DevOps brings in two principles to the software development process:

### Continuous Integration (CI)—

the process of making frequent, small iterations to version control repositories. This alleviates dealing with deployment issues as code is deployed into production frequently.
### Continuous Delivery (CD)
—the process of automating the steps needed to deliver applications and software to production environments.
